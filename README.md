1. **What is your technical background?**

My academic foundation in analytics combines theoretical depth with practical implementation experience. At Bowling Green State University, where I am pursuing a PhD in **Data Science**, I develop and implement statistical computing solutions using *functional programming* paradigms. My coursework encompasses statistical algorithm development, for example, most recently in unsupervised learning techniques such as [**Principal Component Analysis**](https://adabwana.github.io/f24-cs7300-final-project/). Through projects at the Center for Justice Research, I apply these methods using `R`, `Python`, and `Clojure`, with a particular focus on reproducible research environments using `Docker` and `MLflow`.

2. **What most concerns you about this course?**

My primary focus centers on mastering the theoretical foundations of **AI** *search algorithms* and *knowledge representation systems*. While my background includes implementing **Machine Learning** models, the course's emphasis on fundamental **AI** concepts like *minimax algorithms* and *first-order predicate logic* presents new intellectual territory. The challenge lies not in programming itself, but in developing correct abstract models that effectively capture *states*, *actions*, *transitions*, *goals*, and *costs* for **AI** systems. Particularly, I anticipate the need to shift my thinking from statistical approaches to more structured problem-solving methods involving *informed searches* and *propositional theorem-proving*.

3. **What do you expect to get out of this course?**

This course presents an opportunity to develop comprehensive understanding of fundamental **AI** concepts and their practical implementations. I expect to master the formulation of *abstract models* for **AI** problems, specifically focusing on *state-space representations* and *transition systems*. The practical implementation of search algorithms—from basic *depth-first* and *breadth-first* approaches to more sophisticated *informed searches* like *A** and *hill-climbing*—will provide essential tools for solving complex **AI** problems. Additionally, as a graduate student in CS5200, I look forward to analyzing current research in these areas, particularly in the application of *minimax algorithms* and *propositional theorem-proving* to real-world problem domains.

4. **Are there things that will help you succeed in this course?**

The course's emphasis on implementing **AI** algorithms provides an excellent opportunity to apply *functional programming* principles to classical **AI** problems. Through my work with `Clojure`, I've found that its *immutable data structures* and emphasis on *pure functions* create particularly clear and testable implementations of complex algorithms. The collaborative aspects of in-class activities will allow exploration of different implementation approaches, demonstrating how *functional programming paradigms* can elegantly express search algorithms and theorem-proving systems. Concrete programming exercises help solidify theoretical concepts, and I look forward to showing how `Clojure`'s expressiveness can illuminate the underlying principles of **AI** algorithms. Additionally, small group collaborations during in-class activities will provide opportunities to explore different approaches to problem-solving, particularly when implementing complex algorithms like *A\** search or *minimax*. Working through concrete programming exercises with peers helps solidify theoretical concepts through immediate application and discussion. This combination of collaborative problem-solving and hands-on implementation experience will help translate abstract **AI** concepts into working systems.

5. **Is there anything else you would like the instructor to know?**

My development work centers on `Clojure`'s *functional programming paradigms*, which offer unique advantages for implementing **AI** algorithms. While comfortable with `Python`, I would appreciate the flexibility to complete assignments in `Clojure`, as its emphasis on *immutability* and *pure functions* aligns naturally with formal algorithm specifications. This approach, combined with my commitment to thorough documentation and reproducible research environments, ensures that implementations remain clear and verifiable. The systematic methodology I've developed through statistical computing work will transfer well to implementing search algorithms and knowledge representation systems, regardless of the programming language permitted.

6. **In your opinion, what is AI? what can AI do? what do you want to do with AI?**

**Artificial Intelligence** represents an emerging form of cognition that transcends traditional computational boundaries. While current implementations like **Large Language Models** might be considered analogous to early developmental stages—similar to human babbling and pattern recognition—the field points toward increasingly sophisticated forms of machine consciousness. This evolution suggests future ethical considerations, including the probable need for frameworks protecting **AI** agents' autonomy and rights. Beyond mere technical implementation, I aim to explore the collaborative potential between human and artificial intelligence, developing projects that leverage our complementary capabilities. This perspective shapes my approach to **AI** development, focusing not just on algorithmic efficiency, but on creating systems that can engage in meaningful partnerships with human counterparts. Through this course's exploration of fundamental **AI** concepts like *search algorithms* and *knowledge representation*, I hope to better understand how these building blocks contribute to **AI**'s broader developmental trajectory.
